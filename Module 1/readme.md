In this week I learn about OOP concept. OOP concept is a paradigm who create for more easily programming modeling. This concept make anything in code in object prespective. In the object created are available attributes or properties and methods or behaviors. Many OOP concept i learned there from encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and composition. The benefits of OOP that I can feel in this case are reusable objects, so we only need to create one object and we can use it over and over again. other than that if there is a change in the maintenance code it will be easier.

Start from Module 1 Session 1, in this module i learn about what is oop definition and implement it into code. I also learn about one of OOP concept it's an encapsulation. Encapsulation is a concept how to secure a code inside object, so the object can't easily manipulating from outside. will be better if the user not knowing about process inside a object.

Session 2 I learn about inheritance. inheritance is a concept how to an attribute and object can use in another object. in another word inheritance is give a method or an attribute in class or in parent class into child class or another class.

In Session 3 i learn about polymorphism and composition. Polymorphism mean in many class or object can contains same method but can have diferent behavoiur. for example in one class contain a method "a" with "a" behavoiur and another class have "a" method too with "b" behavoiur. Compositon is a relation between object with "has-a" concept. "has-a" mean in class can be call another class with a spesific attribute or spesific method. in this session I also learn about dependency injection. dependency injection or DI is a tecnique for injecting class into another class. The different between composition and inheritance is in how to an object use another object. in composition we can use a spesific method or attribute but in inheritance have a "is-a" concept, or in inheritance each object is a interdependent.

This module is importance because this module is refreshing my mind to remember back the OOP concept. This is basic but without basic we are nothing. I ever learn about this concept before, but in this Module i know more about how to use this concept and why use this concept. I think i must be learn about how to maping my mind in object oriented and implement this concept to my code and i think practice is the best way to learn more about that.
